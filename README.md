# TempLink

TempLink is a secure, ephemeral messaging platform that allows users to create temporary chat rooms for real-time, peer-to-peer communication. No sign-ups, no tracesâ€”just private conversations that disappear after use.

## Features

- **Secure Messaging**: Peer-to-peer communication through WebRTC ensures privacy.
- **No Sign-Ups**: Start chatting instantly without creating an account.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless interaction.
- **Create and Join Rooms**: Generate a unique room code and share it with the user you want to connect for a real-time chat session.
- **Ephemeral Data**: No room data is stored because the connection is directly between the users. Once the room is empty, all nicknames are deleted.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Powered by WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, ensuring fast and secure chat.
- **Text**: Send text messages through WebRTC's Data Channel.
